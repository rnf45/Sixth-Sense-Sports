# GenAI Usage Explained

## User Stories
We used AI to assit in generating an initial set of six user stories, each structured according to industry-standard formatting. Then we had to prompt the AI to build the User Stories with 2-3 Acceptance criteria and also with the standard of a Given...When...Then format for the Acceptance Criteria. Then after that it still didnt have the user story built with a As a...I want...So that... So we had AI build in that format and once that was done we had it translate the user story format into markdown since we couldnt figure out how to get it to work in markdown. 


<br>
This collaborative approach allowed us to balance the efficiency of AI with the insight and creativity of our team, resulting in high-quality user stories tailored specifically to our project.
